This is a project I learnt using ImageAi and machine learning to detect the animal on the image

The data to learn is from MobileNetV2

For example, godzilla.jpg from the folder is used for the program
Then, the program will compare it to the data it train and predict the result

common iguana  :  46.9829
American alligator  :  31.8662
triceratops  :  10.0065
frilled lizard  :  6.1982
African crocodile  :  0.3426


The  result shows that the program predict it is 47% a common iguana which is wrong. 
But it was a fun project to get into the world of machine learning.
